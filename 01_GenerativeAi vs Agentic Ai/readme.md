# 🤖 Generative AI vs Agentic AI

## 📘 Overview
Generative AI creates new content like text, images, or music.  
Agentic AI, on the other hand, can **act intelligently** — it plans, uses tools, and completes tasks on its own.

## 🧠 What Each One Is

### Generative AI
- Creates content from prompts such as text, images, or videos.  
- Works mainly by producing outputs for a single request.  
- **Examples:** ChatGPT writing an email, DALL·E generating images.

### Agentic AI
- Sets goals, plans steps, and performs multiple actions automatically.  
- Can use tools, call APIs, browse the web, or run code.  
- **Examples:** An AI that books flights, manages tasks, or researches online.
