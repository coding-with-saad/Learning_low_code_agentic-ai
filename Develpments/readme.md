**Difference between AI-driven development** and **Spec-driven development**

---

### 🤖 **1. AI-Driven Development**

* In **AI-driven development**, the **AI helps in writing, testing, and improving code**.
* Developers use tools like **GitHub Copilot** or **ChatGPT** to generate code automatically.
* The AI learns from large code datasets and suggests or writes new code for the user.

🧠 **Example:**
You type, “Make a login page,” and the AI writes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for you.

✅ **Main idea:**
AI acts like a smart coding assistant that speeds up development.

---

### 📋 **2. Spec-Driven Development**

* In **spec-driven development**, you first write a **specification** (a detailed plan or document) that clearly defines how the system should work.
* Then the code is written **strictly according to that specification**.
* It’s often used in large or critical projects where rules and structure are very important.

🧾 **Example:**
You first write a document that says:

* “Login button should be blue.”
* “Password must have 8 characters.”
  Then developers code exactly what’s written — no guessing.

✅ **Main idea:**
Follow the written **specs** step by step to ensure accuracy.

### 🔍 **3. Key Differences**

| Feature                     | AI-Driven Development                | Spec-Driven Development                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**                   | Uses AI to generate and improve code | Follows a written plan or specification       |
| **Who drives development?** | AI tools assist developers           | Specifications guide developers               |
| **Speed**                   | Very fast                            | Slower but more controlled                    |
| **Flexibility**             | High (AI suggests new ideas)         | Low (must follow specs strictly)              |
| **Best for**                | Creative, quick projects             | Large, rule-based, or safety-critical systems |

### 💡 **In short**

* **AI-driven development** = AI helps you build software automatically.
* **Spec-driven development** = You build software exactly as written in a specification.
